This is a simple core Java+ Sql application made using Jswings library in java. It uses Mysql workbench as DB.

To connect to DB use JDBC connector.

// create connection conn Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"); conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/store", "aaa", "bbb"); // here aaa is Db login username whereas bbb is password and store is Database name where table is present.
